= Observables and Subscribers

== What's an Observable

== Creating a stream with OnNext

Exercise with an emitter (Observable.create -> ....)
Simple subscriber

Emissions are passed one at a time and sequentially

== Introducing onComplete and onError

== Just a bit of processing

Just a teasing, add map and filter (map(String::length).filter(i -> i >= 6))

== Creating a stream with "just" or "fromIterable"

Same example with just instead of create / emitter

== Subscriber

the interface

Subscriber with 1 lambda
Subscriber with all 3 possibilities

+ examples

== Hot vs. Cold

explanation

=== Cold observable

1 source, 2 subscribers => same output

=== Hot observable

1 hot source (counter for instance), 2 subscribers

=== Connectable observable

take a source  and make it hot
dispatch to all observer at once

1 connectable source -> 2 Subscribers

== Stopping emissions
